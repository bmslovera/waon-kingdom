                    Founded in 1896, 
                    WaoKindom has been provided a wide series of classic stationary worldwide.
                
                    adorable design and professional function, with wide series of product lines, through
                    out acdamic and daily, professionls.Collaborating with online printing kindom, WaoKindom
                    provides a wide range of products, from office supplies like custom note cards and notepads, 
                    to functional items like poster-sized calendars and bar code stickers, plus apparel, 
                    gift certificates and marketing essentials.

                    In the verdant valleys and sun-dappled glades of Waon Kingdom, there are tales of the "Kitten
                    Whisker Meadows," where the youngest cane cats, known for their soft paws and even softer purrs,
                    spend their days in playful harmony, surrounded by blooming pastel flowers and gentle streams.
                    The Harmony Series draws its inspiration from these serene scenes, focusing on a soothing
                    aesthetic that appeals to all ages. Our cane cat appears in its most endearing forms - perhaps
                    curled up for a nap, batting at a floating dandelion seed, or offering a small, comforting paw.
                
                    Stories is a luxurious, WaonKindom concept located in the Design District of Kobe. 
                    A sophisticated evolution of its predecessor, Citizen in Kansai, this concept combines timeless
                    elegance with modern sensibilities. Stories by Citizen is set to become the epitome of upscale
                    social gatherings.
